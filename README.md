This is a utility that will eventually let you view arbitrary Pump it Up custom charts, also known as a UCS player. Eventually, it might even let you play them.

Right now it only supports one hardcoded chart, a double chart that somebody wrote for Obelisque that I downloaded off of the Pump it Up UCS library. When it launches, it will play that chart.

The next thing I'm probably going to add is actual note graphics.

The version on here is also slightly out of date, there's some performance improvements and additional features elsewhere.
