This is a utility that will let you view arbitrary Pump it Up custom charts, also known as a UCS player. Eventually, it might even let you play them. It requires LOVE2D 11.x or later to be installed; once it is, you can run it by running `love .` in the project directory.

Right now it only supports one hardcoded chart, a double chart that somebody wrote for Obelisque that I downloaded off of the Pump it Up UCS library. When it launches, it will play that chart. You can use the number keys to switch the scroll speed.

The next thing I'm probably going to add is actual note graphics.
