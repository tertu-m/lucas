This was an early-stage utility that would let you view arbitrary Pump it Up custom charts, also known as a UCS player. It requires LOVE2D 11.x or later to be installed; once it is, you can run it by running `love .` in the project directory.

It only supports one hardcoded chart, a double chart that somebody wrote for Obelisque that I downloaded off of the Pump it Up UCS library. When it launches, it will play that chart. You can use the number keys to switch the scroll speed.

I put this project on ice once memory errors I ran into on Apple ARM64 became hard to debug, and then I had some insights into more efficient data structures that made this project more or less redundant. Still, I think it's a little cool.
